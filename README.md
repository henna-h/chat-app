# Chat Application

This is a simple chat application made using React and Node.js and uses MongoDB as its database. Styling is done using Styled Components. 

Users can chat either anonymously or create an account and have their username visible for other users.


## Installation

Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/henna-h/chat-app
```

Install npm packages
```bash
npm install
```

Create a MongoDB database. On server side, create an .env file in which you assign the MongoDB connection string to a variable called 'MONGODB_URI'. In the same file, assign the port you are using to variable 'PORT' and a string of your choosing to variable 'SECRET'.

## Running the application

```bash
npm install
```
